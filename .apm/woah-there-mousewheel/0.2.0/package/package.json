Props to derek on the discussion site for the\n[original solution](http://discuss.atom.io/t/scroll-performance-behavior/291/21).\n\nNote that currently open tabs are unaffected when enabling or disabling the\npackage. It's a fun way to compare the scroll speed!\n\n## Installing\n\nUse the Atom package manager, which can be found in the Settings view or\nrun `apm install woah-there-mousewheel` from the command line.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/rzhw/woah-there-mousewheel/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/rzhw/woah-there-mousewheel#readme","_id":"woah-there-mousewheel@0.2.0","_shasum":"11e67f579e5c2e040aad247d7940e3782d5dfb24","_resolved":"file:../d-115816-56744-p7jxop/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115816-56744-p7jxop/package.tgz"}
