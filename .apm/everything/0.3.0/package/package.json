This would not scale.\n\nWith Everything, we create \"providers\". By default, there is only \"commands\" and \"google\" profiler. You can, too, define when each profiler will run - Google will run only if we began to query with \"?\".\n\nMost of all, Everything permits us to find and show different things. In Rails-I18n package, we can query by key or by translation, and Everything will happily find both. It will display the translation and the I18n key in different places, too. Even better, the finding process is asynchronous: we Everything will show (as in the screenshot) that it is still waiting for some provider's answer.\n\nIn the future, we'll be able to bind multiple actions (for instance, we could bind the \"google\" provider with \"open in browser\" as the default, and \"copy URL to clipboard\" as a secondary action).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mauricioszabo/atom-everything/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/mauricioszabo/atom-everything#readme","_id":"everything@0.3.0","_shasum":"55ece97a82681b7e61ad8417d549120f6f243d02","_resolved":"file:../d-115816-62112-g31qeb/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115816-62112-g31qeb/package.tgz"}
